## 👋 About Me

Hi there! I'm Renato Angelo — a Brazilian software engineer passionate about solving real problems through clean, scalable, and meaningful code. 

I’m currently focused on building smart systems — Back-End, Full-Stack, and Front-End — while deepening my skills in advanced Java (and never planning to stop), and diving deep into databases, Docker, and system architecture.
